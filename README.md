## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for running the application.
- **React.js**: The library used for building the frontend components.
- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database that stores application data.
- **Express.js**: The framework used for routing and handling server requests.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM tool for MongoDB that helps model and interact with the database schema.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/trendhora.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**

Visit the MongoDB website to create a new database.
Create a collection named `Items` and insert the sample data provided in `server/ItemsCollection.js`.

3. **Configure the Environment**

In the `server` directory, create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your-mongodb-uri>
```

## Running the Application
To start the application locally, you need to run both the frontend and backend servers.

1. **Start the Frontend**

Navigate to the client directory and run:
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

2. **Start the Backend**

Open another terminal, navigate to the server directory, and run:
```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. **Add dummy data in database**
```
cd server
npm run seed
```

`Tip`: Run both terminals side-by-side to monitor the frontend and backend processes simultaneously.
